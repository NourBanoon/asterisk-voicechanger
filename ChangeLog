	* app_voicechangedial.c: (wait_for_answer): Fixed ringing bug.
	  Before peer is answered, audio from peer is passed to caller.
	  This allows them to hear the rings (or an obnoxious hook from a
	  rap song) as generated by the telco.  I also got rid of the 'r'
	  option because it's dumb.
	  
	  (initiate_call): Fixed CallerID passing problem.  This problem
	  was caused be me not testing and Asterisk having a poor
	  architecture.  You can thank Peter Ericksen for kindly informing
	  me about this problem.
