	* voicechanger 0.7

2009-06-08  J.A. Roberts Tunney  <jtunney@lobstertech.com>

	* app_voicechangedial.c: Rewritten to support new audiohooks API
	  to keep Asterisk devs happy.  Certain features such as DTMF deltas
	  removed temporarilly until I have time to add them back in.

	* voicechanger 0.6

2007-04-03  J.A. Roberts Tunney  <jtunney@lobstertech.com>

	* app_voicechangedial.c: d option is now D(down:up[:delta]).  See
	  README.  Undocumented backwards compatibility with 0.5 is
	  preserved...  for now.

	* app_voicechangedial.c: h and s options are now H(x) and S(x).
	  You can now specify the DTMF digit used to invoke hangup and
	  suicide.  Undocumented backwards compatibility with 0.5 is being
	  preserved...  for now.

	* Makefile: Spruced up Makefile style and we'll have the C
	  compiler generate dependency info instead of that ghetto BSD
	  script.  We're not using K&R anymore people!!!

	* INSTALL: Removed binary installation junk.  Too much trouble.

	* app_voicechangedial.c (initiate_call): Will set
	  AST_CONTROL_RINGING anyway.  I don't think this should hurt.

	  (initiate_call): Will set the channel back to the old read/write
	  formats when done.  This way the voice changer won't blow up
	  with crazy noise if you invoke it twice before the channel
	  hangs up.

	* app_voicechangedial.c: Added 1.4 compatability.  What a bitch.

	* app_voicechangedial.c (bridge_audio): If you leave the ast_write
	  in the default it causes all frame to be written.  I tested
	  calling voicechangedial to chan_local to meetme (without
	  hardware) and it goes in an infinite loop.  If I comment the
	  ast_write(), all goes well.

	* voicechanger 0.5

2006-10-07  J.A. Roberts Tunney  <jtunney@lobstertech.com>

	* app_voicechangedial.c: (bridge_audio): Won't run audio through
	  SoundTouch unless pitch is not equal to zero.

	  (voicechangedial_app_exec): Removed ringing 'r' and hangup on
	  success 'h' options.  They are worthless.

	  (voicechangedial_app_exec): Added 'd' option to specify whether
	  or not you want to allow star and pound to be used to
	  Dynamically change the pitch during conversation.

	  (voicechangedial_app_exec): Added 'h' option to allow the caller
	  to hangup peer by pressing star.

	  (voicechangedial_app_exec): Added 's' option to allow the peer
	  to hangup her/hiself.  This is sort of like committing suicide.

	  (bridge_audio): Fix bug where the either channel could use DTMF
	  to alter the pitch.

	* voicechanger 0.4.1

2006-10-07  J.A. Roberts Tunney  <jtunney@lobstertech.com>

	* app_voicechangedial.c: (wait_for_answer): Fixed ringing bug.
	  Before peer is answered, audio from peer is passed to caller.
	  This allows them to hear the rings (or an obnoxious hook from a
	  rap song) as generated by the telco.

	  (initiate_call): Fixed CallerID passing problem.  This problem
	  was caused be me not testing and Asterisk having a poor
	  architecture.  You can thank Peter Ericksen for kindly informing
	  me about this problem.
