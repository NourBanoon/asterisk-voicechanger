	* app_voicechangedial.c: (bridge_audio): Won't run audio through
	  SoundTouch unless pitch is not equal to zero.

	  (voicechangedial_app_exec): Removed ringing 'r' and hangup on
	  success 'h' options.  They are worthless.

	  (voicechangedial_app_exec): Added 'd' option to specify whether
	  or not you want to allow star and pound to be used to
	  Dynamically change the pitch during conversation.

	  (voicechangedial_app_exec): Added 'h' option to allow the caller
	  to hangup peer by pressing star.

	  (voicechangedial_app_exec): Added 's' option to allow the peer
	  to hangup her/hiself.  This is sort of like committing suicide.

	  (bridge_audio): Fix bug where the either channel could use DTMF
	  to alter the pitch.

	* app_voicechangedial.c: (wait_for_answer): Fixed ringing bug.
	  Before peer is answered, audio from peer is passed to caller.
	  This allows them to hear the rings (or an obnoxious hook from a
	  rap song) as generated by the telco.  I also got rid of the 'r'
	  option.
	  
	  (initiate_call): Fixed CallerID passing problem.  This problem
	  was caused be me not testing and Asterisk having a poor
	  architecture.  You can thank Peter Ericksen for kindly informing
	  me about this problem.
