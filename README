This program is a voice changer module for Asterisk.  This allows you to
change the pitch of your voice in real time when placing VoIP calls.
This software is not intended to change the gender of your voice as no
formant adjustments are not implemented.  This software however does an
excellent job making you sound really creepy and oftentimes
unrecognizable.  Furthermore this software is not intended to guarentee
your privacy as pitch shifting is not a one-way algorithm and hence can
be reversed.

This version uses the audio-hooks API built into Asterisk >1.4.18 and
removes certain DTMF-related features made available in previous
releases.  If you are using a previous version of Asterisk or want those
features, please download release 0.6.  These features may be added
back in slowly or you can send me a patch.

This has only been tested with Asterisk 1.4.x.  I welcome your patches
if this doesn't work with Asterisk 1.6.x

INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For the most pain-free installation, please visit the web page.

Requirements:

 - Asterisk 1.4 (maybe 1.6)
 - Asterisk Development Package (If you installed Asterisk with a
   package manager like apt-get)
 - SoundTouch >= 1.3.0
 - libsoundtouch4c

Run the following commands while inside the source directory for this
program.

	make clean
	make
	make install

If that worked, the module should now be loaded in to Asterisk next
time it is restarted.  If you want to load the Jukebox application in
to a running instance of Asterisk without restart, then issue this
command:

	make start

If you make a change any of the code, you can recompile, intall, and
reload all the modules in to Asterisk with one command:

	make restart

To unload the modules:

	make stop
